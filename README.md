Functionality:

1. A button that saves the (X,Y) coordinates of the phones level to a RecyclerView. I can then view this RecyclerView and the list of all the historical level coordinates with timestamps on a separate view.

2. A notification that only triggers when the level bubble is almost perfectly level. Saving the timestamp, and coordinates (to the RecyclerView, Firebase, or Maps)
